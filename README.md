# 🌱 Digital Bonsai — Grow with Your Mind

A calming, minimalist journaling web app where your thoughts grow a virtual bonsai tree.  
No streaks. No pressure. Just slow, intentional growth.  

Every journal entry is a drop of water. Every breath is sunlight.  
Your bonsai waits patiently, growing only when you’re ready. 🌿
